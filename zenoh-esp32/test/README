# Actors architecture 
- the platform is composed of different independent tasks that wait for messages
- the tasks can emit messages , where the expectation is that these are not-blocking handlers
- tasks emit messages which support the Serializable trait, so that CBOR or JSON serilaization is handled in one place
- each actor publishes its own properties and meta-data 
- actors are glued together at main level by attaching events to commands 
- Notions of Rust are used where possible
