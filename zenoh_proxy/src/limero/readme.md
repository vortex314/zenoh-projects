# Why another Actor framework ?
- Simple to re-use across embedded systems based on embassy and tokio on linux, the implementation is dfferent but API should look the same
- Support decoupled actors via queues and async  
- Support immediate functions as message consumers
- main code shpuld provide __glue functions__ between actors
- make actors as much as possible context free of other actors. 
- Support __pub/sub__ of events generated by actors
- Support messages with and without __reply capability__
- Considered actor frameworks : rector, actix, acteur 
- Support multiple message interfaces in a single actor see Alice Ryhl article
- Support __timers and timeouts__

# Abstract

Commands ==> ActorRef => Queue ==> Commands ==> Actor ==> Events
                                    Timer    ==> Actor ==> Events
                                                Actor ==> Commands ==> Actor_2
Commands_2 => Actor ==> Events
             ACtor ==> Events ==> Function ==> Commands ==> Actor_3
