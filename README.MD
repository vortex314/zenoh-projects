# An evaluation project of Zenoh 
## Observations
Zenoh is feature rich and would permit my own design to be much more efficient
- datat routing based
- timestamping
- discovery
- query
- speed
- optimized protocol

Looks good on paper, letś go.

## Regrets
### Serial doesn´t work or is not fully implemented yet.
See zenoh-serial README.MD
